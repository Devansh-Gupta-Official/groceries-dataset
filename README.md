# Apriori Algorithm for Association Rule Mining
This repository contains Python code for implementing the Apriori algorithm on a groceries dataset to discover association rules between items.

## **Dataset**
The analysis is performed on the 'groceries.csv' dataset, containing transactional data of purchases with item lists

# **Steps Involved**
1. Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset and prepare the transactions for association rule mining.
2. Training the Apriori Model: Utilize the Apriori algorithm to extract association rules based on specified thresholds for support, confidence, lift, and item set length.
3. Visualizing the Results: Display the extracted association rules, including support, confidence, and lift values for each rule.

## **Usage**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the groceries.csv file is available in your repository.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to observe each step's output and analysis.
5. Customize the model by adjusting parameters, exploring different evaluation metrics, or using other datasets.

## **Files**
